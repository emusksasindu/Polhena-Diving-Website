Diving in cenotes: everything you need to know before you go

Imagine how excited I was to return to Mexico after 12 years: the once baby scuba diver, with less than 50 dives on her logbook, could finally come back with her complete scuba gear and camera set-up to report how incredible diving in cenotes is. Even after hundreds of dives worldwide, the cenotes remain one of my most magical diving adventures to date. There is simply nothing like it anywhere else in the world.  There are some places you know immediately you’ll come back. Playa del Carmen is one of them. But 12 years and a pandemic later, prices have skyrocketed. To prepare for your trip to Yucatan, if diving in cenotes is your main objective, there are more than a few things to be aware of to prepare and budget accordingly. I’m even extending this article to the other cenotes of Yucatan worth a visit to get a broader understanding of these miracles of nature that only exist in Mexico.  In my 6 weeks in the Yucatan Peninsula, visiting the three states of Quintana-Roo, Campeche and Yucatan, I explored 11 cenotes. Based on my experience, I picked a diverse range of cenotes among the hundreds open to the public so that you can choose according to your tastes, your scuba diving level and your budget.
